2023/1 I joined the competition to create the ML that would predict the HousePrice. This ML model is my first ML that I created and I was inspired by the other notebook in the compitition(I attach the reference notebook in my colab).

As the result, after trying 26th times my score is 0.12137 or top 10 % of over all summision(updated 2023-03-05). you can explore more about my model code in the file above [a link](https://github.com/Kritkikomo/HoursePricing-model/blob/main/Week4_Housepricemodel_175_chakrit.ipynb)
